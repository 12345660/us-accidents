## Content:

## Part I. Exploratory Data Analysis
https://github.com/RonghuiZhou/us-accidents/blob/master/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20for%20the%20NJ%2C%20PA%20%26%20NY%20data.ipynb

### Step 1. Import libraries
### Step 2. Parameters, dataset and data manipulation
   #### A. Define parameters
   #### B. Import the dataset
   #### C. Data manipulation: extract year, month, day, hour, weekday, and time to clear accidents
### Step 3. Exploratory Data Analysis -- General
   #### Accident visualization A: accident map
   #### Accident visualization B: time series analysis, resample by month
   #### Accident visualization C: accident severity distribution for each state
   #### Accident visualization D: how long does it take to clear the accident?
### Step 4. Exploratory Data Analysis -- WWW (When, Where, & Weather)
   #### Question 1: When do most accidents happen?      
   ##### A. Daytime versus nighttime
   ##### B. Weekday versus weekend
   ##### C. Rush hour

   #### Question 2: Where do most accidents happen?      
   ##### A. County
   ##### B. City
   ##### C. Zipcode
   ##### D. Street side
   ##### E. Location

   #### Question 3: With what weather condition do most accidents happen?      
   ##### A. Top weather conditions with accidents
   ##### B. Accident severity for the top 3 weather conditions
   ##### C. Weather conditions for each accident severity (2, 3, & 4)

Guideline
Student must have a Github repository of their project. The repository must have a README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements. Students should not use another student's code to complete the project, but they may use other references on the web including StackOverflow and Kaggle to complete the project.
